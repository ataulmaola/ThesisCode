The United States' trade war with China, started on the basis of intellectual property rights violation and the repeated devaluation of the RNB by China against the US dollar, has led many world leaders to rethink the way the world economy has so far been globalised.
The ongoing trade war and the resulting retaliatory measures taken by the two sides have forced their respective businessmen to find alternative partners in order to protect their business interests. Bangladesh, the second largest exporter of RMG products, can make good use of this.
Bangladesh could become a preferred country for US buyers. We already have a long relationship of trade with the US. In the meantime, various international trade fair events held in countries like France and others have allowed our business owners to showcase the products their companies have to offer.
