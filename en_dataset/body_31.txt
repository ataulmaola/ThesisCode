The schedule for the Dhaka University Central Student's Union (Ducsu) has been announced at last. After 28 years, Ducsu polls are poised to take place on March 11. As many as 42,000 voters will cast their votes in their respective halls this year as per the DUCSU constitution.
Several opposition-affiliated student organisations, however, have expressed doubt whether the election would be fair as polling booths would be set up inside the dormitories that are dominated by the pro-ruling party student organisation. Bangladesh Sadharan Chhatra Odhikar Sangrakkhan Parishad has also voiced its concern. But the atmosphere on campus has so far been largely peaceful.
The Ducsu was formed in 1922, a year after the university was established. The aim of the platform was to promote cultural activities at the university and foster a spirit of cooperation among the students of different dormitories.
