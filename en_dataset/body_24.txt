The education system in Bangladesh is such that the majority of students have to depend on coaching centres instead of classrooms. Over the last few years, coaching centres in the country have mushroomed.
Many are weighing in on the ban on coaching centres. While the dependence on coaching centres is indeed alarming, will banning these centres guarantee quality education in classrooms? I don't think so.
Bangladesh's education system suffers from other issues. For instance, the budget allocated to the education system is perhaps the lowest in South Asia. Furthermore, the teacher recruitment process is seriously flawed. The meagre salary of teachers is also a driving factor behind many teachers focusing on coaching centres. Even public university teachers have begun to spend a lot of time in private institutions.
Before banning coaching centres, the authorities should assess the various other factors that are driving demand for coaching centres. They should first take measures to improve the quality of overall education in classrooms.
