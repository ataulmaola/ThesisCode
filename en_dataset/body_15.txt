I had recently travelled over the Kushtia-Meherpur highway. On the land adjacent to the highway, I could not see anything being grown except for tobacco.
Tobacco is an extremely addictive substance mostly used in the production of cigarettes, bidi, cigars, etc., all of which are harmful to human health. Even the tobacco farmers and their close family members are often afflicted with various skin and respiratory related diseases.
The decomposition of tobacco leaves, use of insecticide and fertilizers needed to grow tobacco are leaving our soil barren. Forests too are being destroyed and used as fuel wood that is needed to cure tobacco leaves.
