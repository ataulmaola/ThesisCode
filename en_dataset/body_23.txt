Advancing community health is central to achieving the SDGs and universal primary healthcare. The foundations of community health within the context of primary healthcare are increasingly being recognised as crucial components of national policies and strategies to accelerate progress in health.In rural Bangladesh, community clinics (CCs) are the closest health facilities for the community people. CCs are the lowest-tier health facility at the primary level established throughout the country including in very hard-to-reach areas. Thousands of people are getting services from there and they have become an integral part of the health system.
