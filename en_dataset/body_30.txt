On February 11 The Daily Star published a report titled “Boys dropout highest in seven years”. The report said that nearly 36 percent of boys dropped out before completing their secondary education. However, it was also reported that the overall dropout rate has gradually been declining, meaning female dropout rate is exceptionally declining.
The importance of female education is well-understood. To encourage female education, the government has taken a number of incentive programmes as women in Bangladesh are considered as a vulnerable group.
However, the reported increase in the dropout of boys from schools is worrisome. This could be linked to poverty and child labour. Attention should be given to why this is happening, despite progress in many social indicators.
