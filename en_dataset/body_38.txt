“So are you not going to get the golden GPA-5?” I'm sure many meritorious SSC examinees have heard these very words uttered by their parents or others after the Bengali 2nd paper exam.
My brother was a candidate. He said the MCQ questions were pretty hard and he might not get an A+. I feel sorry for my brother, but what shocked me the most was that he was very worried particularly about the reaction he might receive from our family if he misses out on the golden GPA-5.
Whether knowingly or unknowingly, guardians nowadays are putting immense pressure on their children. In the process, their true potentials are being hurt.
We always want them to become doctors, engineers or bankers. Which seldom gives them a chance to think outside the box. I personally know some very successful professionals who regret pursuing the profession that they did. My brother wants to become a footballer. Why, then, are we forcing him to be an IBA graduate?
We all understand that education is a must. But the purpose of getting educated is not to earn a golden GPA-5, but to find our own unique way of living a golden life.
