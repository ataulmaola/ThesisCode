Family is the best social platform through which any initiative for gender equality could be properly addressed. The first step would be to acknowledge the fact that we need to accept the reality that men, women and people of third or alternative gender are all equal and should be treated and respected appropriately. At the family level, we need to always emphasise the importance of equality for all, particularly in front of the childrenso that the sense of equality for all is imprinted on their minds. If we learn to empower and respect women at our family level from a truly socio-cultural perspective, we could expect some positive changes in society, however small they are. This is a serious social movement in which we all need to participate sincerely to ensure gender equality at both macro and micro levels.Â
