According to a report citing a study titled “Combined effects of climate change and sea-level rise project dramatic habitat loss of the globally endangered Bengal tiger in the Bangladesh Sundarbans,” the remaining tigers in the Sundarbans may become extinct within 50 years. The rise of sea level due to climate change and global warming may inundate the habitats of tigers in the forest. Reports say poaching by hunters and construction of factories within the forest are some of the factors that threaten the endangered species of the Royal Bengal Tiger. It is also forecasted that climate change will hamper the growth of the famous Sundari trees, which the Sundarbans are known for. Something should be done to protect the tigers' habitats and save these animals from possible extinction.
