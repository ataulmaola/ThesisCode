The Daily Star has recently published a news item along with a photo regarding the demolition of illegal structures in Aminbazar, Dhaka. We frequently read about such incidents. I wonder why a costly affair such as demolition is required when the authorities could have easily blocked the illegal construction in the first place.
Why have they waited till the grabbers completed the construction and enjoyed its benefits for years? The government should be serious about this kind of activity. In addition, there should be a monitoring mechanism in place comprised of the relevant agencies which will monitor illegal land grabbing.
