As we know, the use of polythene, a non-biodegradable item and the most common plastic, has become widespread around the worldâ€”to the point that it is now one of the biggest threats to our environment. Discarding polythene in the soil amounts to leaving this toxic material there forever. Yet, although this is common knowledge, the use of polythene continues for various reasons and the market is saturated with polythene products.
The government has declared that people will soon have an alternative. Biodegradable polymer bags made from jute, or golden bags, will be released in the market. These golden bags will help brand Bangladesh internationally, and they are environment-friendly. There are also considerations for the private sector to eventually manufacture and market these bags. In appearance, the bags resemble polythene bags already available in the market, but are stronger and more durable. Made of jute cellulose, these poly bags decompose and mix with the soil faster. They are being seen as an excellent alternative to the existing polythene bags. It is clear that with government patronage, the private sector too will come on board and help make this initiative successful. This will certainly be a step forward for our environment.
