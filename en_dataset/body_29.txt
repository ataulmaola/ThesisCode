Decades ago, our predecessors paid a heavy price in order to uphold the dignity of our mother tongueâ€”an act perhaps unparalleled in world history. February 21 has since been recognised as International Mother Language Day by Unesco. On this day, we remember their great sacrifice with deep gratitude and reverence.
We should pay our respects to them throughout the year, not only on Shaheed Dibosh or the National Martyrs' Day, as the day is commemorated in Bangladesh. In every aspect of our life, Bangla should not be neglected. That would be the perfect homage to the martyrs.
