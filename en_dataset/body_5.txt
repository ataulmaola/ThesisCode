I read the article titled “DUCSU elections 2019: Let's not play with the students” published in Star Weekend of The Daily Star on March 1. At the end of the article, the writer said that if Dhaka University cannot deliver a fair and transparent election, it would be a great shame for the university as well as the whole nation. I think the students of DU as well as the people of the country feel the same way. If this election is manipulated, it will set a bad precedent for  other public universities.
We hope that the university authorities will not favour the candidates of any particular student organisation. They should take all the measures necessary for holding an election that will be acceptable to all. On election day, the most important thing for them to do will be to ensure that there is no violence on campus and that students can cast their votes freely, without any intimidation. The much-awaited election will be held tomorrow. We hope that Dhaka University will be able to save its reputation.
