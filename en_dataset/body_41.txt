The incident of the three-year imprisonment of Jaha Alam over a false case of embezzlement of money from Sonali Bank is tragic. Three years ago, the innocent man, a jute mill worker by profession, was wrongly identified as the suspect of an allegation of stealing money, in place of the real offender. Consequently, he had to spend jailtime for a period of three years. Such injustice is not acceptable at all.
Only for the mistakes of the authorities concerned, he lost out on a long period of his life. Had the media not brought the matter to light, he would have had to spend more time in prison. Such types of injustices must not go without trial. The people involved in the case must be given exemplary punishment. Jaha Alam must also get due compensation for his irreparable loss.
