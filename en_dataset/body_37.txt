The news that the High Court has asked the government to take measures to protect rivers from grabbing and pollution is a welcome step. Subsequently, the government has reportedly demolished 656 illegal structures. In addition, the government is said to have taken a Tk 850 crore project to intensify the drive against river grabbers.
The authorities concerned are reportedly planning to install 12,000 demarcation pillars, build some 50-km-long walkways, plant trees along the walkways and set up three eco-parks at riversides. These initiatives are quite commendable. Now, the challenge is to implement the projects successfully.
