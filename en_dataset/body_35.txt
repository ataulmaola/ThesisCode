The High Court has recently ruled in favour of a government directive that banned school teachers—both governmental and non-governmental—from owning or being a part of any coaching centre. In addition, teachers have been restricted from tutoring their own students outside the school or classrooms.
The step was taken to address the conflict of interest associated with the practice. It is often heard that some teachers force their students to take private tutoring from them or else they receive poor grades in exams. It is also reported that as some teachers prioritise private tutoring, they tend to neglect classroom teaching. In the process, even primary school students are compelled to attend coaching centres.
We hope that the HC ruling will be implemented without any delay. At the same time, the working condition, salary and other benefits of school teachers must be taken into consideration, and improved where necessary, for a better impact.
