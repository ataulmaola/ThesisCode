The recent dam collapse in Brazil that left at least 99 people dead with over 250 people missing is truly tragic. The event has sent shockwaves throughout the world. After the incident, the issue of safety measures for workers has resurfaced. Some have said that the collapse of the dam was many years in the making. And it marked the second such incident in Brazil in the last three years.
This should serve as a lesson for the world. It is time we began telling our policymakers and businesspeople that there is no alternative to having serious safety measures in place for those working in essential yet risky jobs. Countries should also be prepared to face such situations through proper evacuation plans. The safety of countless people who are employed to build and protect critical public infrastructures should be given the utmost importance by the authorities concerned.
