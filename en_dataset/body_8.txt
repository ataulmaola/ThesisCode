“Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” This quote of John F Kennedy reflects the emotions of this month—March. In this month in 1971, the people of this country rebelled against the injustices of the then West Pakistan at the call of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. They became united and declared war, not caring about the dangers and deaths they would have to encounter. They were fearless; their only aim was to make the country independent. Our deepest gratitude to the freedom fighters who were able to free the country only in nine months. They will always shine like bright stars in our sky.
But sadly, after 48 years of independence, everything seems to have changed. It seems that people now do not care about their country anymore; they are obsessed with making money and are willing to go to any length for their petty interests. All sorts of crimes have increased in our society. We have been watching this degradation with deep sorrow and we wonder whether the day will come when we will be able to stand holding our heads up high.
