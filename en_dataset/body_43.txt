As reported by The Daily Star and other news outlets, a madrasa teacher and imam of a local mosque was beaten up for allegedly trying to prevent a child marriage in Noakhali. It's a disturbing incident and calls for swift action from the law enforcement authorities against the perpetrators.
The incident is significant for various reasons. It's important for religious leaders such as an imam of a mosque to intervene against child marriage. Their opposition to child marriage is extremely crucial to defeat the social curse as they are highly regarded in society and their opinion taken seriously by the general populace.
Therefore, the stance against child marriage taken by the imam in question was an encouraging sign. If other imams follow suit, there will be a real change hopefully. However, the way the imam was treated could discourage other religious leaders from adopting a similar stance. The authorities should take a hard stance against those who beat the imam.
