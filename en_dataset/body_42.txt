It is certainly good news that no question papers from the ongoing SSC examinations have been leaked so far. The education ministry, with the help of the law enforcement agencies, is living up to its promise. They have reportedly detained two networks that illegally leak question papers.
If the ministry is eventually successful, it will be viewed as yet another example that the government can turn around a bad situation if it really intends to do so.
I genuinely believe that if there's a strong will among the policymakers, they will be able to solve many pressing issues that affect us every day.
