I'm sure we will soon forget about the Chawkbazar tragedy just like we quickly forgot about the Nimtoli inferno, especially as the media covers one sensational story after the other such as the recent attempt to hijack a Dubai-bound Biman plane. The truth is that we never analyse the root cause of any accident or take steps in a planned manner to solve a problem. Rather, we resort to blame game. Instead, we should constantly be highlighting the myriad problems plaguing many industries in this city, one of which is the utter lack of implementation of existing laws. This should be the first step if we are to prevent deadly manmade disasters from recurring.
