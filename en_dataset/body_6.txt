The other day, while passing the Nabisco intersection, Tejgaon, I noticed that garment waste and other garbage were dumped on the footpath on the opposite side of the road. This spot has long been used as a local dumpsite. How are pedestrians supposed to walk on footpaths when waste is indiscriminately dumped like this? No wonder many pedestrians end up jaywalking, essentially endangering their lives, simply because there is no space for them to walk. There are various other repercussions including health issues. I would like to request the local authorities to keep the footpaths clean.
