When leaders in a workplace encourage honest behaviour and treat all employees equally, workers are more likely to be honest. On the other hand, corruption and dishonest behaviour of leaders in a workplace encourage employees to engage in corruption by misusing power for personal gain. Workplace ethics should not be taken lightly and it is every leader's responsibility to conduct oneself in a manner so as to encourage honest behaviour in employees.
