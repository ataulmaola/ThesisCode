Kishoreganj, my native town, is undergoing a massive urbanisation process. Several multi-storied buildings are being constructed, for which a large amount of construction material is needed. For storing sand, bricks, stones or rods, landlords are using adjacent footpaths, causing trouble for pedestrians.
The roads across the town are already narrow, and this practice makes them even narrower. The dust from sand and bricks engulf and pollute the air.
The local administration and municipal authorities are well aware of the problem, but they are yet to take any meaningful actions. If the problem persists, the plight of the local residents will exacerbate. It is high time the authorities took measures against it.
