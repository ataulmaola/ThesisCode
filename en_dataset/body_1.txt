It is very unfortunate that contestants from most student wings boycotted the March 11 Ducsu election over allegations of massive irregularities and they also demanded fresh polls. Many irregularities have been reported in the media like the periodic halts orchestrated at some polling centres as well as long queues of students. General students and witnesses also reported various wrongdoings such as rigging, preventing voters from casting ballots and filling boxes with marked ballot papers.
The DU is recognised as the centre of many progressive movements in our history. All major socio-political movements have been initiated from this campus. So the Ducsu election, held after 29 years, came with great expectations but it's painful to see the way it panned out. Even some who had contested in Ducsu elections during Pakistani rule said that such irregularities did not occur during those elections. The picture of one poster that went viral on social media on March 11 said that the very spirit of DU died during this Ducsu election!
The DU authorities should, therefore, look into all these gross irregularities and take necessary steps in this regard.
