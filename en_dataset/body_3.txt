We are very happy that the Ducsu election is going to be held today after 28 years. The last election to Ducsu was held in 1991. According to section 9(Ga) of the electoral code of conduct of Ducsu, no candidate or person can intimidate or use force on any rival candidate or voter and bar them from casting votes. Also, section 15(Kha) says that anyone violating the code of conduct may face a fine of a maximum of Tk 10,000, cancellation of candidature, expulsion from the university or punishment as per relevant laws of the university or the state. The university authorities must ensure that the code of conduct is not violated by anyone on Election Day and that the students can vote freely. We want to see smiles on the faces of the approximately 43,000 student-voters.
