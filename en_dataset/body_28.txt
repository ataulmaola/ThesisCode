Two police officials in Saturia, Manikganj are reported to have drugged a young woman and raped her for two nights and, in punishment, they have been "closed" from their duties. Only a few days back, two other police personnel reportedly picked up two men and demanded Tk 15 lakh as ransom. In the recent past, some have been caught red-handed in the Yaba trade.
It is disquieting and appalling that those who are to apprehend criminals are themselves committing criminal acts and bringing disgrace to the whole entity. Offenders must be meted out exemplary punishment.
