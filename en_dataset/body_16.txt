We, the students of DU, want a free and fair Ducsu election, which is going to be held on March 11, after 28 long years. All the residential and non-residential students should be able to freely attend the election campaigns without being threatened and vote for the candidates of their choice.
However, students are not satisfied with the arrangements of the polls as the demand of most of the student bodies—setting up polling booths in academic buildings—has been ignored by the university authorities. Their decision to set up the polling centres at the residential halls may give way to opportunities to manipulate the voting process. Thus, we want assurances from the university administration that they will take every possible step on their part to ensure a participatory election. All the student organisations should be able to participate in the election—and not just one student organisation. To put it simply, the election must be held in a manner that is acceptable to all.
