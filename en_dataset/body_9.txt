Although gas cylinders are not yet standardised, they are being carried by vehicles and used all across the country. The size and measure of the steel as well as other materials used to make a cylinder need to be standardised. Also, the list of the manufacturers should be published in newspapers and an authorised government body should be given the responsibility to check if they are okay to be used. It was alleged that the Chawkbazar fire originated from a gas cylinder explosion. We should be careful about using cylinders so that any such accident doesn't ever occur.
