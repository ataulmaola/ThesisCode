We have so far watched several exciting matches in the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League (BPL). But that was because of the excellent performances by foreign players such as AB de Villiers, Chris Gayle or Alex Hales. With the exception of a few Bangladeshi players who performed well, our local players mostly put up a poor show. It is time they identified and worked on their weaknesses which would be beneficial for us ahead of the upcoming World Cup.Â
